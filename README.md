## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework


### Continued development

I didn't use the useContext() hook in this projects although it would be optimal to however i wasn't familiar with it.
I plan to be more familiar with the react hooks and i plan to learn React router and a database of my choice in the near future.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me find the right utility classes for the styles i wanted to apply as it was the first time i used tailwind in a solo project.
- [React Documentation](https://www.example.com) - I read the documentation and was able to improve my react code e.g. removing redundant state, lifting state up in the tree.
